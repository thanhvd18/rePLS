# Residual Partial Least Squares Learning

This repository contains code, scripts, and resources for the study of Residual Partial Least Squares (rePLS) for statistical learning and neuroimaging analysis.


## Installation
```
pip install rePLS
```

## Data

- Data used in this project are from the following sources:
  - [ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/)
  - [OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies)](https://www.oasis-brains.org/)

For visualize in brain space, you can use Matlab with [plotSurface](https://github.com/thanhvd18/plotSurface) or Python with [PySurfer](https://pysurfer.github.io/) .

## Usage
 - Run all experiments:
```bash
bash exps/run_all.sh
```
 - Generate a specific figure:
```bash
bash exps/run_figure1.sh
```
